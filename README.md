Start the Docker container:

Launch the Docker container that simulates the environment for the buffer overflow exploit. 
This container could be running the vulnerable program you want to exploit. 

Get the relevant port number from the Docker container:

The Docker container might expose services, like SSH, on specific ports. 
Use Docker commands (e.g., docker ps or docker inspect) to find the port number that the service (SSH) is using, as it may not always be the default port (22).

Ensure the SSH function has the correct port number:

In the script or tool you are using to exploit the buffer overflow, ensure that the SSH connection function uses the correct port number retrieved from the Docker container. 
This ensures the exploit targets the right service through the correct port.

Run the script to get a remote SSH connection:

Once the correct port is set, run the exploit script. The script will likely use the buffer overflow vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the target system via SSH.

Run the target program to get the flag:

After successfully gaining access to the remote system through SSH, navigate through the directory using the necesary commands to gain access to the file containing the flag.
